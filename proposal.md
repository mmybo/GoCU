In order to speed the flow of searching websites for matching words, we propose creating a Go Crawler Utility API (GoCU)

The project we were working on was benefitted by providing users with information about items they made requests for.

The purpose of this project is to make it easy to scrape the web for information on items for sale, with the urls for the users to find them on.

This way, we direct traffic toward online marketplaces, while also onboarding users to go to us to find them.

Think of how, in the film "Miracle of 34th Street", Macy's profited by providing customers with the stores that were selling the items they were looking for. And, by doing this, people came to Macy's first to find everything.

In the same way, users will come to us to find the items they are searching for, before going anywhere else.

To use, simply make a post request using jSON, naming the word to search for and the domain.

And GoCU will handle the rest, returning the title of the page and URL to access it
